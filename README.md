## Getting Started

This project is a [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-cordova`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin cordova
```

Then you can integrate it into your Fastlane setup:

```ruby
platform :ios do
  desc "Deploy ios app on the appstore"

  lane :deploy do
    match(type: "appstore")
    cordova(platform: 'ios')
    appstore(ipa: ENV('CORDOVA_IOS_RELEASE_BUILD_PATH'))
  end
end

platform :android do
  desc "Deploy android app on play store"

  lane :deploy do
    cordova(
      platform: 'android',
      keystore_path: './prod.keystore',
      keystore_alias: 'prod',
      keystore_password: 'password'
    )
    supply(apk: ENV('CORDOVA_ANDROID_RELEASE_BUILD_PATH'))
  end
end
```

with an `Appfile` such as

```ruby
app_identifier com.awesome.app
apple_id apple@id.com
team_id 28323HT
```

## Run tests for this plugin
